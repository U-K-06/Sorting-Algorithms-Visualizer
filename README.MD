<h1>Sorting Algorithm Visualizer</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer will help you visualize how different sorting algorithms work. It will help you understand how the algorithms work and how they differ from each other. The visualizer is built using C++ and uses Python for generating plots.

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

**Files** and **Directories** within the project are listed below:

- **`Algorithms`**: Contains the implementation of different sorting algorithms.

- **`Graph_Generation`**: Contains the Python script for generating plots.
