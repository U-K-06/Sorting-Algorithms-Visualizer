# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** will help you **visualize** how different **sorting algorithms** work. It will help you understand how the **algorithms** work and how they differ from each other. The **visualizer is built using C++** and uses **Python** for generating plots.

## Project Structure

**Files** and **Directories** within the project are listed below:

- **`Algorithms`**: Contains the implementation of different sorting algorithms and sending of the data to the python Files.

- **`Graph_Generation`**: Contains the Python script for generating plots.


## Sorting Algorithms
Following sorting algorithms can currently be visualised:
-  **Bubble Sort**

-  **Insertion Sort**

-  **Selection Sort**

-  **Merge Sort**

-  **Quick Sort**

-  **Bogo Sort**

## Installation

To run the visualizer, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- **Python interpretor**

- **C++ Compiler**

Then open your terminal and install the **required Python libraries** using the following command while being in the project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
